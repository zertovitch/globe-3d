  <li><b>What is GL / OpenGL</b>.<br>
  GL, ``Graphics Library'', is a quasi-language allowing to render, among others,
  3D forms on a 2D screen area
  in a very simple way, without needing to know about the hardware and the operating system.
  Despite a continuous development to catch the features of new graphic cards, GL was
  so well designed from the beginning, that using the features of the original GL
  version (~1992) deliver pictures of amazing realism - and of course a lot faster
  and with a better resolution than then. In many respects, GL resembles to Ada: 
  a clever design that avoids the momentaneous hardware or operating system constraints,
  allowing to perfectly survive, along with the code developed in these languages,
  to changes of hardware and systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  <li><b>Drawing with the plain GL / OpenGL</b>.<br> 
   You can summarize the steps to perform a rendering as:
   <ol>
    <li>Prepare the link between the computer and GL. GLUT does it in a totally portable way,
	    but you have gateways between many GUI systems (Windows, GTk, X Window,...) and GL.
		(see Start_GLUTs in the <tt>Mini.adb</tt> demo)
	<li>Prepare the perspective, lighting, display modes of GL
        (see Start_GLs in the <tt>Mini.adb</tt> demo)
	<li>Display forms. For the 3D, it boils down to displaying a mesh of triangles (eventually rectangles).
	    For displaying a single triangle, GL makes it extremely easy:
		<ol>
		  <li>GL.GL_Begin(GL.TRIANGLES);
		  <li>GL.Vertex( vertex_1 ); GL.Vertex( vertex_2 ); GL.Vertex( vertex_3 );
		  <li>GL.GL_End;
		</ol>
		Now, along with the second step, you may want also to pass a "quasi"
		normal vector associated to vertices, to have nice
		lighting, and also texture coordinates if you want an image "sticked" onto
		your triangle. You can also, before the first step, mix colours to textures, and this
		in the various modes of infography: diffuse, emissive, etc.
		You can play with transparency.
		It's where it begins to be complicated...
   </ol>
   <br>
   <br>
  <li><b>What GLOBE_3D does</b>.<br>
      GLOBE_3D organizes and facilitates the display of 3D meshes.
      Basically, it defines an object type, Object_3D, containing vertex coordinates, a list of
	  faces referring to these vertices, and all informations about textures, colours,
	  materials. <br>
    That way, you prepare your objects, and once they are defined,
	  all you need is to call GLOBE_3D.Display( my_object ). The management and loading of
	  textures is done by GLOBE_3D altogether. All you need there is to name one or two zip files
	  containing the textures (in TGA or BMP formats) and to give the texture names
	  when defining the faces.
  <br><br>
  <li><b>Animation</b>.<br>
  The animation is obtained by constantly redrawing the scene, with
  a moving point of view and/or moving objects. Since the drawing begins with a black sheet,
  drawing directly to the screen would give a disturbing flickering. It is why the double-buffer
  technique is used: buffer 1 is being drawn while the other, buffer 2, is shown, and when the
  drawing on buffer 1 is done, the buffers are swapped and buffer 2 will be drawn; and so on.
  It doesn't matter if the scenes are drawn too often, it is visually disturbing only when
  they appear in a to slow rhythm (less than 24 images per second).
  <br><br>
  <li>
  <a name=portal>
  <b>Portal rendering</b>.<br>
  Displaying, say, an entire city as a single object would be
  too slow. Especially, the spectator only sees small portions of it, so most of the city's
  polygons would be hidden by others. A solution to that is the portal rendering technique.
  The city is subdivided into many smaller objects. A house in the city will be typically
  subdivided into rooms. Say the spectator is in room A and is looking in room's B direction<br>
  <br>
  <center>
  <table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=5>
    <tr><td rowspan=3>Room A &rarr;</td><td bgcolor=lightblue>3</td>
	    <td rowspan=3>Room B</td>
		<td rowspan=5>Room C</td></tr>
    <tr><td bgcolor=lightgreen>7</td></tr>
    <tr><td bgcolor=cyan>17</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan=2>Room D       </td> 
	    <td>Room E</td></tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  <br>
  During the construction of the scene, if there are 3 windows between room A and room B,
  they will be, in room A, be faces, say, 3, 7, and 17. Then it is just a matter of setting
  <tt>A.face(3).connecting:= B;</tt>
  <tt>A.face(7).connecting:= B;</tt> and
  <tt>A.face(17).connecting:= B;</tt> in order to have room B displayed correctly.
  Perhaps the three portions of room B will have different colours if the windows are
  coloured differently. Note that the Ada variable <tt>B</tt> is an access to the real
  object, of type <tt>p_Object_3D</tt>. Of course, room C can be seen as well, so
  through the magic of recursion, it will be displayed befor room B.
  For the details on how invisible parts are clipped away and stop the recursion in a 
  natural, geometric way, see procedure <tt>Try_portal</tt> in <tt>GLOBE_3D</tt> main package body.
  For displaying the portals' frames to see how it works "in live",
  set <tt>show_portals</tt> to <tt>True;</tt> in the package <tt>GLOBE_3D.Options</tt>.
  <br><br>
  <li>
  <a name=bsp>
  <b>Binary space partition (<b>BSP</b>)</b>.<br>
  In order to locate an object among a multitude of a scene's objects,
  there is a straightforward dichotomy method consisting in splitting
  the space with planes until all objects can be found unambiguously.
  This is practical for knowing in which object the spectator currently is,
  given his coordinates. The package <tt>GLOBE_3D.BSP</tt> provides such a
  <tt>Locate</tt> procedure. We reuse the above map for showing two possible
  partitions, the second one being obviously better balanced.

<b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">Navigating in 3D with the main GLOBE_3D Demo.</font></b>
<p>
As a preliminary note, here is what is needed to run the <b>demo</b>, GLOBE_3D_Demo.
    In the same directory, you need:
  <ul>
    <li>the executable, <b>GLOBE_3D_Demo.exe</b> (Windows)
    <li>the resource files: <b>g3demo_global_resources.zip</b> and <b>g3demo_level_resources.zip</b>
    <li>FreeGLUT for Windows: <b>freeglut.dll</b>
  </ul>
  If you unzip the whole globe_3d.zip archive, you get the right files
  at the right place, that is in the ./demo directory.
  <p>
  Here are navigation instructions for the demo
     (at some point of time there will be configuration files; meanwhile
      you can change control settings in Game_Controls.adb and recompile;
      note also that the letter keys are for a QWERT keyboard):

 There are also command-line options for special purposes:
 <ul>
 <li> <tt>-dump</tt> : dumps all objects in the demo as <tt>.g3d</tt> <tt>.bsp</tt> files
 <li> <tt>-load</tt> : load both objects ("bricks") of the "space station" demo,
                       instead of creating them with Ada code
 <li> <tt>-load=mylevel</tt> : sets "mylevel.zip" as level resource; from that resource, loads
                               mylevel_$_area#.g3d with #=1,2,3...; loads mylevel.bsp.

 <b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">How to <b>build</b> the project on various platforms and compilers:
 </font></b></a>
 <p>
  The <tt>GLOBE_3D_Demo.adb</tt> or the much simpler <tt>Mini.adb</tt> demo, in directory <tt>./demo</tt>,
  can serve as a prototype for your applications using GLOBE_3D.
  That directory also contains various scripts (or so) for various systems.
  <ul>
   <li> <b>Windows</b>:
    <ul>  
     <li> <b>GNAT</b> compiler:<br>
         - [using then GNAT Programming Studio (GPS):] open the <b>globe_3d_demos.gpr</b> project file, then press F4.<br>
       or<br>
         - launch <b>make_all.cmd</b> .<br>
       Then you get GLOBE_3D_Demo.exe.

     <li> <b>ObjectAda</b> compiler: open <b>globe_3d_objectada.prj</b>, then press F7.

     <li> another compiler: should be fine, just need GL, GLU, and, for the demo only, (Free)GLUT bindings
    </ul>
   <li> <b>Linux</b>:<br>
    To force lower case on file names: unzip -L globe_3d.zip;
    for the Ada files (*.ad*), the "-a" or "-aa" option may be useful to ensure you get
    the correct end-of-line codes.
    <br>
    <ul>
     <li> <b>GNAT</b> compiler:<br>
         - [using then GNAT Programming Studio (GPS):] 
           open the <b>globe_3d_demos.gpr</b> project file, choose Scenario OS_Kind = linux, then press F4.<br>
       or<br>
         - from a terminal, run: <tt>gprbuild -P globe_3d_demos.gpr -XOS_Kind=linux</tt>
    </ul>
    As a prerequisite, you need some libraries to be installed.
    When building a GLOBE_3D project, the linker will tell you what is eventually missing.
    These libraries might be (see the linker section in the .gpr file for an up-to-date list):
    <b>GLU, GLUT or FreeGLUT, Xi, Xext, Xmu</b>.
    For example, on the Ubuntu and Fedora distributions, and surely on most other Linux distributions,
    the installation is pretty easy: search from the
    software installer (Add/Remove software, or the package manager) the libraries mentioned above,
    select the "lib*-dev" or "lib*-devel"
    package (e.g., libxi-dev) and push the install button. 
    NB: for FreeGLUT the name might be something like freeglut3-dev (no "lib" in front).
    Don't try to rename library components or add symbolic links, you might end up with a version mess.
   <li> <b>Macintosh (Mac OS X)</b>:<br>
You need first to install the X11 server within your Mac installation DVD; then you'd better to force 
lower case on file names and to ensure you get the correct end-of-line codes: 
unzip -La globe_3d_xx.zip; (don't use -aa option).
Then build FreeGlut, see instructions in obj/libmac. 
    <br>
    <ul>
     <li> <b>GNAT</b> compiler:<br>
         - [in GPS:] use the globe_3d_darwin.gpr project file (might be replaced by the common globe_3d_demos.gpr at some point)<br>
       or<br>
         - gnatmake -P globe_3d_darwin.gpr
     <li>
Execution:<br>
- export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=../obj/libmac/lib<br>
- ./globe_3d_demo<br>
or<br>
- ./mini<br>
    </ul>
   <li> <b>Other systems</b>:<br>
    Should be fine, just need GL,GLU,(Free)GLUT.
    Any volunteer ?...

 <p>
  <ul>
   <li> 
    Graphical &amp; performance considerations
    <ul>
     <li> Avoid using <b>textures</b> whose dimensions are not power of two, because
          they are not supported by GL versions under 1.3 and when they are supported,
          the display is way slower than their 2**m &times; 2**n rescaled equivalents
          (on a certain video accelerator, &#126;30 times slower!).
     <li> The face-by-face <b>visibility culling</b> is done by OpenGL and/or the graphics card,
          but you can improve it by not displaying or clipping whole chunks that are obviously not
          or only partially visible. This is done by the <b>portal</b> technique.
          For that you have to subdivide your scene or bigger objects into several smaller objects
          linked through invisible faces (the portals). In the demo, the first and last scenes use
          this technique.
          You can make the portals visible by setting GLOBE_3D.Options.show_portals to True.

    </ul>
   <li> You can use GLOBE_3D's I/O framework to load textures even for some renderings
        without GLOBE_3D (e.g. by displaying a "2D" image with GLUT_2D.Put_Image).
        To that purpose, call GLOBE_3D.Textures.Check_2D_texture(id), then do your
        rendering with GL.BindTexture referring to image number id+1 (<b>caution</b>: note the +1,
        since the user textures in GL begin with 1 and the ones in GLOBE_3D with 0,
        as the Ada 'Pos attribute does.
   <li> If you develop a GLOBE_3D application with GNAT, a good starting point is to clone
        a project file from the ./demo directory (globe_3d_*.gpr) and adapt it..
  </ul>
 </p>
<li> 
 <a name=tools>
 <b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">Tools provided with GLOBE_3D</font></b>
 </a>
 <p>
  In the <tt>./tools</tt> subdirectory, you find the following tools:
  <ol>
   <li> <tt>./tools/wavefront</tt> contains an Ada program, <b>o2g</b>, for translating a Wavefront
        3D model, usually stored as a pair of files model.obj, model.mtl, to a GLOBE_3D binary
        object, model.g3d, that GLOBE_3D.IO is able to load in an application.<br>
        The Wavefront format is text-based and very simple. You can write or customize by hand a simple 3D model in
        this format. On the other hand, most 3D modeling programs like Blender or 3D Studio are able to export models
        into this format, so you can access complex, multi-textured models this way.<br>
        Additionally, <b>o2g</b> stores model.g3d and the needed textures into a zip file, model.zip,
        making it easy to visualize the object with the main GLOBE_3D demo (GLOBE_3D_Demo.exe -load=model).
   <li> <tt>./tools/gmax</tt> contains a script, <b>max2ada.ms</b>, for the GMAX software, to convert a 3D model
        into a package capable of generating the equivalent GLOBE_3D object.
        To use it, run the script from GMAX, and use GMaxSLGRAB.exe to grab the Ada code
        from the "listener" window. Example of its output is Dreadnought.ads/.adb in <tt>./src/models</tt> 
   <li> <tt>./tools/vrml</tt> contains an Ada program, <b>wrl2ada.adb</b>, for translating VRML code into an Ada package
        capable of creating a GLOBE_3D corresponding to the VRML world / object.
        Example of its output is Lissajous.ads/.adb in <tt>./src/models</tt>
   <li> <tt>./tools/doom3</tt> contains two tools that take as input a .proc file that is written
        by id software's Radiant level designer family (the editor provided with Doom 3 is one of them).
    <ul>
     <li> <tt>./tools/doom3/to_ada</tt> contains a source translator, <b>d3a</b>, similar to the VRML one.
          The generated Ada code builds the level's objects and areas, connects the areas through
          portals and builds a BSP tree.
          Its advantage is the one of having Ada source code for generating 3D worlds (no I/O or file
          format issues), but even a small level produces a huge Ada source that becomes a challenge to
          some compilers.
     <li> <tt>./tools/doom3/to_g3d</tt> contains a file converter, <b>d3g</b>, that uses GLOBE_3D "behind the scenes"
          for building in-memory the objects and then write binary files (.g3d, .bsp) that GLOBE_3D.IO is
          able to load in an application.<br>
          The batch script <tt>procpack.bat</tt> allows a relatively easy way
          to automatize the packaging of a game level.
          If you have such a file (search the Internet for
          "<a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=Doom+3+Map>Doom 3 Map</a>" or
          "<a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=Quake+4+Map>Quake 4 map</a>"),
          extract the <tt>.pk4</tt> file, that is indeed a .zip file.
          Then, put all textures in, say, <tt>mylevel.zip</tt>. 
          That .zip file is supposed to have no directory structure (otherwise, you need to
          have the same as in the .proc file and remove the "-j" option in d3g calls).
          Store <tt>mylevel.zip</tt> in the <tt>./tools/doom3/to_d3g</tt>.
          In the same directory, put the .proc file, renamed if needed as
          <tt>mylevel.proc</tt> in order to have the same name.

          If you have copies of Doom 3, Quake 4, or any game of that family,
          you may want to adjust the line with "<tt>d3tex.zip</tt>" in
          <tt>procpack.bat</tt>. The file <tt>d3tex.zip</tt> is supposed to contain
          all the textures in the original game (in Doom 3, textures are in <tt>pak004.pk4</tt>).
          You also need the <a target=_blank href=http://www.info-zip.org/>zip and unzip</a> utilities.
          When everything is ready, run "procpack mylevel".
          You'll get an updated <tt>mylevel.zip</tt> with all needed textures,
          3D objects corresponding to areas and the BSP tree.
          <tt>GLOBE_3D_Demo -load=mylevel</tt> will then load the game level,
          and you can navigate in it...
    </ul>
   <li> <b>gl_overloader.adb</b> : a simple procedure that writes a chunk of Ada code,
        with overloaded names for various GL routines with different C names
        for different parameter list. You find the result GL.ads in the <tt>./bindings</tt> subdirectory.
   <li> <b>check_tiling.htm</b>: a mini HTML file just to visually check if a texture is periodic enough.
  </ol>
  <br>
  Note: the conversion tools from vrml and doom3 above are based on
  a grammar you may want to modify (the *.y and *.l files).
  To that aim, you need the AYACC and AYFLEX tools. They are available in the SVN repository on the GLOBE_3D
  project site (.extras/aflex95.zip, .extras/ayacc95.zip),
  as well as in the P2Ada project's archive (see Web resources below).

   <li> (Game_control/GLUT) Modifier keys are not updated independently of the others key down/up events.
   <li> GLOBE_3D.Random_extrusions needs to split a quadrilatere into two triangles when it is not flat
        or even when it is not a rectangle (bad display on at least one ATI card)
   <li> d3a (doom 3 level translator): some surfaces seem to be missing (e.g. parts of pipes)

    <b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">To-do list</font></b>
  </a>
  (some items may go beyond the scope of graphics and GLOBE_3D):
 <p>
  <ul>
   <li> Move reusable parts of the big demo to Game_Control or other packages (GLUT.Windows in the works)
   <li> Game_Control: add support for configuration files
   <li> 3D Studio / GMAX: see in the max2ada.ms file
   <li> (demos) improve lightings, better calibrate mouse movements
   <li> I/O: store texture name only if different
   <li> implement sub-objects or neighour-objects (linked lists)
   <li> make a demo or a game with <a target=_blank href=http://coreland.ath.cx/code/openal-ada>OpenAL-Ada</a>
        (sound/music).
   <li> Implement an
        <a target=_blank href=http://www.web3d.org/>X3D</a> (the successor of VRML)
        translator or reader
   <li> VRML: support for textures
   <li> GL.IO: JPEG support, since some photos are not too damaged by JPEG compression
        and of course much smaller in storage;
        probably a translation of the PasJPEG library to Ada (see
        <a target=_blank href=http://datacompression.info/JPEG.shtml>here</a>) with P2Ada
        would be fine
   <li> add a facility for the <a target=_blank href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_effect>Vertigo effect / Dolly zoom</a>
  </ul>

  <b>Many thanks</b> to Rod Kay, for the new evolutive object-oriented type tree around the 3D object,
  major improvements of GLOBE_3D rendering
  for polygon soups, GLUT.Windows, GLUT.Devices, and nice demos (terrain
  mapping, multi-window views).<br>
  Also thanks to:
  <ul>
   <li> W. M. Richards, Pascal Obry, Jerry van Dijk for the Ada bindings to GL, GLU, GLUT.
   <li> Marc A. Criley for the Linux implementation &amp; bindings versions.
   <li> Ali Bendriss for the (old) Linux makefile, testing and the proper way to exit GLUT!
   <li> St&eacute;phane Perret, for advice on user controls and the idea of the
        Sierpinski sponge - see
        <a target=_blank href=http://www.vive-les-maths.net/>here</a> for more...
   <li> Pascal Pignard and Uwe R. Zimmer, for the Mac OS X / PowerPC tuning &amp; testing
   <li> John Howard, for the new Linux/Unix make script
